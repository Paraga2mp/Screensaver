# Screensaver


A Java program creates a simple graphical screensaver, which demonstrates graphics, 
polymorphism, and other OOP concepts.

When first run, the screensaver app appears as a lank window. Whenever the user 
clicks anywhere in the window, a random shape will be created and appear onscreen, 
and will start moving around the window. The user should be able to add as many 
shapes to the screensaver as they want, by continuing to click on the window.
